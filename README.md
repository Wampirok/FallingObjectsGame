# Falling Objects Game

Older Java project created to practice Java programming and basic game development concepts.

## About the project
Simple desktop game written in Java using JavaFX.
The player controls a circle and tries to catch falling objects to score points.
The main goal of this project was to create a fully working game with basic mechanics such as:
- object movement and animations
- collision detection
- keyboard input handling
- score counting

## Technologies
- Java
- JavaFX

## Project status
This project is not actively developed.
It is kept public as part of my learning history and Java background.

## Notes
The main focus of this project was functionality and gameplay rather than clean architecture.
If I were to work on this project today, I would:
- improve code structure
- add automated tests where applicable
